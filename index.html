        <p> Since I lack creativity and don't enjoy designing at all, front-end development didn't really cross my mind. 
            However, as I participated in the online group training, I have realized that there is still more to discover about the things 
            related to the course I have taken that I am capable of doing. Even though it can be confusing and annoying when I can't use the tags and 
            elements very effectively, I am sure that I will improve over time.</p>
